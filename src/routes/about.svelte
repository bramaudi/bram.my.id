<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name's <strong>Brama Udi</strong>, someone who officialy have this site (of course).</p>

<p>That image was a cute little dog, <strong>not me</strong>.</p>

<p>I am is a Full-stack web developer, not working for any companies (not yet) but i have contribute on some organizations (like my own organization for example).</p>

<p>Programming is not my main hobby but it was my passion (even though sometimes i feel worried about my future), and my other hobbies are drawing, read & writing, that's it.</p>

<p>By the way, thanks for wasting your time by read "about me", it was so meaningful for me &hearts;</p>
